I really enjoyed working on this assignment. 
I ended up getting slightly behind in some of my other classes. I've found after I get started on something I have a very hard time letting go until I have it working.

I look very roughly 25 hours on this assignment.
Week of 2/20/23
Friday - some time
Tuesday - (Monday instruction) ~ 5 hours
Wednesday - (Snow day) ~ 4 hours
Thursday - (skipped class ) ~ 2 hours
Friday - ~ 2-6ish, 9:30-11ish ~ 5ish hours
